**Salary Classifier**
**Overview**:
This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to classify whether a person's salary exceeds a certain threshold based on various features such as education, experience, occupation, etc.
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of individuals' information, including their salaries, to predict whether their salary is above or below a specified threshold.

**Files**:
salstat.py: This script contains the code for training the machine learning model using the provided dataset.
Income.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.It includes features such as education level, years of experience, occupation, salary, etc.

**Dependencies**:
The following dependencies are required to run the scripts:

Python (>= 3.6)
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

**Dataset** :
The dataset (income.csv) used for training the model contains information about individuals, including their education level, years of experience, occupation, salary, etc.
Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and labeled for accurate model training.

**ML Algorithms**:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
K-nearest Neighbour.

**Model Evaluation** :
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
These metrics provide insights into how well the model classifies individuals' salaries and its overall effectiveness in distinguishing between high and low earners.
